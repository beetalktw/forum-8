{"forum": {"content": "Hi~ I\u2019m Zach. I would like to join/compile a group practicing English, sharing life experience and then broaden our social network. We could have topics from bbc.learningenglish.com or some interesting topics from hot news. I think from this, we could learn basic sentences and vocabulary and then practice putting then in conversation. Not only be brave to speak in English, but also have some input of our lexical items. Well~ if you have the same mind and desire to have a partner to conquer English. I could be the one you are looking for. Hope everyone get great improvement in this group.", "images": ["http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/f1565a8b8d3862ba6f80b14863076bae"], "urls": [], "title": "Hsinchu"}, "threadStatus": 0, "regionId": 886, "barStatus": 0, "barId": 724, "postBy": {"utc": 1527379743000, "level": 2, "location": "Hsinchu City\u00b7Taiwan", "avatar": "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/-6530019345983101182", "name": "\u55ae\u7d30\u80de"}, "id": 8588119}
