However, how do you learn a new language quickly and effectively as an adult?<br /><br />Chris Lonsdale is a psychologist from New Zealand who runs a company in Hong Kong. He\u2019s been interested in accelerated learning his whole life. After spending many years assessing all of the research available on language learning, he was able to formulate five principles and seven actions that will allow any normal adult to learn a new language and speak it fluently in six months.<br /><br />I discovered Lonsdale\u2019s approach when I came across his TED Talk.

Focus on language content that is relevant to you. Why do you want to learn to speak a second language? Look at the following:<br /><br />- Do you want to learn Italian so that you can understand opera? If so, then concentrate on words and phrases that you would hear in Puccini\u2019s operas.<br />- Do you want to learn to speak Mandarin so that you can communicate with your business partners in China? Then focus on learning words and phrases in Mandarin that are related to business.<br /><br />2. Use the new language as a tool to communicate. Instead of simply learning the language in an academic setting, put yourself in situations which force you to use the language in order to be able to communicate with others.<br /><br />3. When you first understand the message, you will unconsciously acquire the language.
